## Important Notice

This is **NOT a vulnerability in Supabase itself**.

The issue demonstrated in this repository is the result of an **application-level misconfiguration** where Row Level Security (RLS) policies were not properly enforced by the application developer.

Supabase functions as designed; improper policy definitions can lead to authorization issues if not carefully implemented.
